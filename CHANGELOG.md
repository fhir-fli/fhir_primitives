## 0.1.2

- Removed xhtml, technically its not a primitive
- Added a FhirBase class, the abstract class that all other FHIR objects extend or implement

## 0.1.1

- Just some cleaning
- And added xhtml


## 0.1.0

- Because it's helpful to have a single version of primitives for use with all versions of FHIR
