## 0.1.3

- Added lots of functionality to FhirBase (required for mapping)
- This does mean that none of the primitives are now constant unfortunately

## 0.1.2

- Downgraded meta

## 0.1.1

- Added a FhirBase class, the abstract class that all other FHIR objects extend or implement
- Just some cleaning
- And added xhtml

## 0.1.0

- Because it's helpful to have a single version of primitives for use with all versions of FHIR
